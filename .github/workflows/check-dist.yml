# In TypeScript actions, `dist/` is a special directory. When you reference
# an action with the `uses:` property, `dist/index.js` is the code that will be
# run. For this project, the `dist/index.js` file is transpiled from other
# source files. This workflow ensures the `dist/` directory contains the
# expected transpiled code.
#
# If this workflow is run from a feature branch, it will act as an additional CI
# check and fail if the checked-in `dist/` directory does not match what is
# expected from the build.
